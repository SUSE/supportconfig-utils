# Show all synchronization points between Crowbar nodes, sorted
# chronologically, with all matches highlighted and colour-coded
# according to the node:
#
# Type 1 sync points are highlighted if they are critical,
#     i.e. "create-" on the founder, which is assumed to be node1, and
#     "wait-" on other nodes.
#
#     N.B. this highlighting only appears after pressing 'x' to toggle
#     display of filenames, which requires my patch:
#
#         https://github.com/tstack/lnav/pull/372
#
#     which is included in my OBS package of lnav:
#
#         https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:aspiers:branches:server:monitoring/lnav
#
# Type 2 sync points ("sync-") are also highlighted.
#
# Also include the beginning of each chef-client run, and any mentions
# of FATAL.
#
# This helps debugging synchronization, especially bsc#935462 (missing
# synchronization means chef-client runs on cluster nodes drift apart)
